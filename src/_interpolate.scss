/// Builds a set of media queries, where for each of the screen width points a set of properties is applied.
/// Any value in between these points is achieved by using linear interpolation.
/// For the screen widths bigger than specified, the first value in properties' list is applied by default.
/// For the screen widths smaller than specified, the last value in properties' list is applied by default.

/// @param $screen-widths-list - A list of screen width points
/// @param $properties-map - A map of properties' names and lists of values to achieve at certain screen width points
/// @param $outside-screen-widths - A list of values defining what rules will be applied outside of the specified
///   screen width points. First value defines what will happen above maximum, the second one - below minimum.
///   If only the first value is specified, then the second value will be equal to the first
///   Possible values: none, keep-value (default), keep-interpolation
/// @returns A set of properties and media queries to achieve certain values in certain screen widths.
